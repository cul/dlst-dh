Phillip R. Polefrone is a PhD candidate in Columbia's Department of English and Comparative Literature, working on the digital humanities, 20th-century American fiction, and ecocriticism. His [current work](https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/dcip/2016/10/28/967/) combines literary mapping and natural language processing, using semi-automated location extraction and georeferencing to examine distributions of literary locations across large corpora of texts. Previous projects include: [semantic analysis of one million "Gamergate" tweets](https://sipa.columbia.edu/system/files/experience-sipa/14-Polefrone_GamerGate.pdf); and "[Roget Tools](https://github.com/prpole/roget-tools)," a semantic analysis tool using the word category hierarchies in Roget's Thesaurus to look for semantic patterns and correlations.
