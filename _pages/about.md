This site was commissioned by the Dean of Humanities, Sharon Marcus in 2016. The bulk of the architecture and editing was done by Manan Ahmed, Susanna Allés Torrent and Alex Gil with the help of our communities. We owe a particular debt of gratitude to Columbia University Libraries for their support, and the crucial role they play in fostering digital humanities at Columbia.
