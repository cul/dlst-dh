<em>sx:archipelagos</em> seeks to substantially reduce the cost of open access academic publication by adapting a minimal computing workflow to the needs of an stablished journal. As pressures mount on academic journals, the need to reduce costs while providing manageable workflows and multivalent outputs has increased. The <em><a href="http://smallaxe.net/">Small Axe</a></em> journal has weathered two decades as the flagship journal for Caribbean Studies and thus provides a great platform for experimentation around an established journal, as opposed to new experiments that must build prestige while trying out new workflows. <em>sx:archipelagos</em> was born as that experimental branch. The goal of <em>sx:a</em> is to publish a combination of articles, digital project reviews, and digital humanities ventures with low periodicity and under reduced cost.

This project was made possible with generous support from the NEH <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/announcing-17-digital-humanities-start-grant-awards-march-2015">Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant Award</a>.
