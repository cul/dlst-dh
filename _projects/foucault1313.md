The Columbia Center for Contemporary Critical Thought and the Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University, with the support of the Maison Française, the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society, and the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures, offered these 13 seminars on Foucault's 13 lectures at the Collège de France (1970-1984) over the full 2015–2016 academic year at Columbia University. The seminar series was open to Columbia faculty, fellows, and students, as well as faculty and students from other New York universities.

The seminars are now available on-line, including both the full AV recordings of the sessions and the articles published by all the contributors. Please click above on the 1/13 through 13/13 tabs to see each individual seminar.  Welcome to Foucault 13/13!
