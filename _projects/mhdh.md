This set of exhibits and document collections highlights some of the most important and distinctive aspects of Morningside Heights transformation by documenting the construction and expansion of its key sites. They are the results of the work of the first iteration of the Developing Librarian Project. It also narrates some of the history of the institutions that moved to the neighborhood, and the moves themselves. Visitors can view maps, photographs, architectural drawings, newspaper clippings, postcards, and other materials, all of which provide an intimate look at specific moments and places in the creation of modern Morningside Heights.
