Books are the material evidence of cultural and intellectual history. As material artifacts, whether written by hand or mechanically printed, they preserve not only written texts, but also information about production modes, reading habits, book ownership, and the book trade. An Islamic book can be made by and for Muslims or non-Muslims, because the adjective “Islamic” refers to Islamic civilization and is not restricted to the faith itself. Against this backdrop, this blog (ISSN 2328-8167) explores manuscripts, printed books and ephemera in Arabic script within the wider perspectives of the social, cultural, and intellectual history of the transmission of knowledge among Eurasia, Africa, and North America.  It combines posts concerning research on Islamic books with stable pages that are dedicated to two topics: the history of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at Columbia University and resources for the study of Islamic books.  The latter is organized as a systematic bibliography which includes sections on finding aids for rare holdings in Arabic script in the Columbia University Libraries and a bibliography of publications about these holdings.
