*In the Same Boats: Toward an Intellectual Cartography of the Afro-Atlantic World* is a work in progress of multimodal scholarship designed to encourage the collaborative production of humanistic knowledge within scholarly communities. The platform comprises a series of overlapping, interactive maps that trace the movements of seminal cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe within the twentieth century Afro-Atlantic world. Easily accessible, visually impactful, and content-rich, these maps propose a generative resource for twenty-first century scholarship concerning the long-historical impact of afro-Atlantic figures across a vast networked geo-
cultural space. More precisely, the project charts the extent to which Caribbean, African, Latinx,
European, and Afro-American intellectuals have had opportunities to be in both punctual and sustained
conversation with one another: attending the same conferences, publishing in the same journals and
presses, active in the same political groups, perhaps even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian cafés and on the same transatlantic crossings – literally and metaphorically in the same boats – as they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, and Europe. In the Same Boats aims to facilitate a literal retracing of hemispheric black studies, drawing attention to the multiple sites of potentially interconnected Afro-Atlantic theoretical and creative production.

The beta version of the site is slated for release in the Spring of 2017.
