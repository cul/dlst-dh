The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) partners with faculty, students, and colleagues across the University to support excellence and innovation in teaching and learning. The CTL is committed to advancing the culture of teaching and learning for professional development, curricular enhancement, and academic support through its programs, services, and resources.

The CTL understands teaching as a critical practice, driven by inquiry, experimentation, reflection, and collaboration. We promote pedagogy that is inclusive, learner-centered, and research-based. We support the purposeful use of new media and emerging technologies in the classroom and online to foster the success of Columbia’s instructors and students.

The CTL inherited the former Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL), which built many of the projects featured here. CTL continues to maintain all of them.
